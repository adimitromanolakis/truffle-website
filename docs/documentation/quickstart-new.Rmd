Fast shared segment and ancestry estimation. 


# Quickstart


## Introduction 
Estimating relatedness and co-ancestry among pairs of individuals is a commonly encountered task in most association or 
population genetics studies. TRUFFLE enables the simple and accurate identification of IBD1 and 2 segments, 
calculation of total IBD1/2 probabilities and provide graphical reporting of distribution of shared segments 
across pairs of individuals. 


## Important Notes for this release

Truffle is currently under development and a beta version has been released. This means that while the main algorithm has been validated in numerous datasets, there might still be some loose ends.

We ask you to notify us of any problems or errors encountered. If truffle works perfectly you can also send us an email with your experience.


## Input file requirements

For the most common use case, truffle requires a single *whole-genome* vcf input file with genotypes for every individuals. 

Most vcf files should be readable as input. If you have a plink bed/bim file that you previously ld-pruned and filtered, truffle can use it as long as you convert it back to vcf using the plink command `--recode-vcf`.

It is also possible to run single-chromosome or single region analysis, for identifying segment locations and sizes. In such cases it might be necessary to adjust the thresholds for detecting segments.

## Number of marker requirements

For this pre-release version we recommend filtering down the markers of the vcf file to 100-500k.

If you have an unfiltered vcf file with < 10 million markers, truffle has embedded functionality for filtering the vcf file before analysis.

## Default filtering criteria

By default truffle filters out markers with minor allele frequency < 5% or missing data > 5%. If you would like to include all markers in analysis you can use the option `--nofiltering`.

## Quickstart


VCF file with 60-200k markers:

```sh
./truffle --vcf input.vcf.gz --cpu 4
```


Unfiltered VCF file, with millions of markers:

```sh
./truffle --vcf input.vcf.gz --cpu 4 --mindist 2000 --maf 0.1
```


Also generate a list of segments identified:

```sh
./truffle --vcf input.vcf.gz --cpu 4 --segments
```


## Example data

You can download a VCF file used for the examples below from:

[fs-and-po-pairs-from-1000genomes.vcf.gz 4.5MB](https://adimitromanolakis.github.io/truffle/fs-and-po-pairs-from-1000genomes.vcf.gz)

This dataset includes 47 selected CEU samples from 1000 genomes sequencing data, including some parent-offpring and full-sibling pairs.



## Other types of analysis

Truffle can read most common vcf files as input to the segment detection algorithm. The file should, generally, contain
all chromosomes from all individuals. Currently, there is no support for joining vcf files from different chromosomes.

For most common use cases, the vcf file should contain autosomal chromosomes only.

## Running a single chromosome

If you would like to perform segment identification on a single chromosome, the sensitivity should generally be adjusted, see below for options `--ibs1markers` and `--ibs2markers`


## Output a list of segments

To generate a list of segments in the file truffle.segments use the option `--segments`:

```sh
./truffle --vcf input.vcf.gz --cpu 4 ---segments
```

```

The output file columns are:

* ID1,ID2  :  ID's of pair.

* NMARK : number of markers that were used.

* NCOMMON : not used.

* IBD0,IBD1,IBD2 : The computed proportion of genome that is IBD0,1 or 2.


* IBD1_MAX : The maximum length of segment found to be IBD1 or 2.
* IBD2_MAX : The maximum length of segment found to be IBD2.

* IBD1_NSEGS : Number of segments that are identified as IBD1 or 2.

* IBD2_NSEGS : Number of segments that are identified as 2.


In the above output file we find that the 5 first pairs are unrelated (IBD1,2 < 0.001).

The pair  P10_HG03754        P10_HG03750 is identified as a parent offspring pair (IBD1 > 0.95).

The last pair is definetely a full-sibling, having IBD1 > 0.4, IBD2 > 0.15.

in the original vcf file

# Notes for using truffle


## Segment detection sensitivity

Truffle has some build-in measures to adjust the sensitivity of the segments detection.

The default sensitivity threshold should produce reasonable but maybe not optimal, results for whole-genome autosomal marker panels. In many cases you might need to adjust it, for example when:

* running exome sequencing data,
* analyzing studies with mixed ethnicity individuals,
* analyzing single chromosomes.

In most cases, you get more than expected relatedness and you might want to consider adjusting the parameter L to 1.5-3. For example:

```sh
./truffle --vcf input.vcf.gz --L 2
```

For more precise minimum segment size control, you can specify exactly the minimum number of markers that a segment must have before it is considered for reporting in the output.

There are two parameters to control the minimum lengths for IBS1 and ISB2 segments: --ibs1markers n1 and --ibs2markers n2. For example


```sh
./truffle --vcf input.vcf.gz --ibs1markers 4000 --ibs2markers 500
```



### OPTIONAL: LD-pruning and filtering steps for genotyping array data

The following commands show a suggested pipeline for performing LD-pruning of variants and minor allele frequency pruning before running truffle:

```
plink --bfile input --maf 0.05 --mind 0.2 --make-bed --out /tmp/t
plink --bfile /tmp/t --maf 0.05 --geno 0.05 --make-bed --out /tmp/t

plink --bfile /tmp/t --indep-pairwise 2000 100 0.5 --out /tmp/t
cat /tmp/t.bim|awk '$1<=22' >/tmp/autosom.txt
plink --bfile /tmp/t --extract /tmp/t.prune.in --make-bed --out /tmp/t2

plink --bfile /tmp/t2 --extract /tmp/autosom.txt --recode-vcf --out /tmp/filtered
```






# Commonly used command line options

### Input/Output control


* `--vcf vcffile` <br> Reads the input `vcffile` for processing.

* `--segments` <br>  Output a list of identified segments in the file truffle.segments

* `--out X ` <br>  Change the name of the output files. The results will be stored in the files X.ibd and X.segments

### CPU usage control


* `--cpu N ` <br> Use N cpus when running truffle.


### Segment length threshold

* `--L X` <br>  Adjust the sensitivity threshold for detecting segments to X. Increasing L causes only larger segments to be reported.<br> Default: 1. 
For more specific marker length detection adjustments:


* `--ibs1markers n` <br>  Set the minimum segment length to report to n consecutive markers, for IBS1 segments.

* `--ibs2markers n` <br>  Set the minimum segment length to n consecutive markers, for IBS2 segments. This is generally 2-3 time smaller than the value of ibs1markers.



### Variant filtering

* `--maf *X* ` <br>  Remove variants that have a minor allele frequency less than X. For example: `--maf 0.05`

* `--missing X ` <br>  Excludes variants with missing rate more than X. For example `--missing 0.02`

* `--mindist X` <br>Removes variants that are less than X base-pairs apart.For example `--mindist 2000`


### Other options

* `--pair ID1 ID2` <br>  Analyze only a single pair from the data
